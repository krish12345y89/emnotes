# **Detailed Notes: Force System & Equilibrium**

---

## **1. Basic Concepts**

### English:

* **Force** â†’ A push or pull acting on a body which changes or tends to change its state of rest or motion.
* **Particle** â†’ A point mass having no size, only mass.
* **Rigid body** â†’ A body that does not deform under action of forces (ideal case).

### Hinglish:

* **Force** ek push ya pull hota hai jo kisi body ki rest/motion ko change karta hai.
* **Particle** = sirf mass rakhta hai, size negligible maana jata hai.
* **Rigid body** = ek aisa body jo force lagne par bhi deform nahi hota (ideal assumption).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

* **Particle** â†’ Planet motion (Earth around Sun considered as particle).
* **Rigid body** â†’ A steel rod in mechanics problems.

## **2. Particle Equilibrium**

### In 2-D

* If a particle is in equilibrium:
  **Î£Fx = 0** and **Î£Fy = 0**

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
A block on smooth floor pulled by two ropes:

* Force F1 = 10 N (x-direction)
* Force F2 = 10 N (â€“x direction)
  Then Î£Fx = 10 â€“ 10 = 0, so block is in equilibrium.

### In 3-D

* Condition:
  **Î£Fx = 0**, **Î£Fy = 0**, **Î£Fz = 0**

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
A balloon tied with 3 ropes in x, y, z directions. If tensions balance the balloon weight, it stays at rest.

---

## **3. Rigid Body Equilibrium**

* For a rigid body, forces + moments must balance.
* **Conditions in 2D:**
  **Î£Fx = 0, Î£Fy = 0, Î£M = 0**
* **Conditions in 3D:**
  **Î£Fx = 0, Î£Fy = 0, Î£Fz = 0, Î£Mx = 0, Î£My = 0, Î£Mz = 0**

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
A ladder leaning on wall â†’ must satisfy both force and moment balance.

---

## **4. System of Forces**

### (a) Coplanar Concurrent Forces

* All forces lie in one plane and pass through one point.
* Resultant = vector sum.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Wires meeting at one joint.

### (b) Components in Space

* A force can be resolved into x, y, z components.
* F = âˆš(FxÂ² + FyÂ² + FzÂ²)

ðŸ‘‰ Example: A rope pulling at angle (60Â° from horizontal and 45Â° from vertical plane). Resolve it into Fx, Fy, Fz.

---

## **5. Resultant of Forces**

* **Resultant Force (R):** A single force which can replace all the given forces.
* Methods: Parallelogram law, Triangle law, Polygon law, Resolution.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
Two forces 30 N (x-dir) and 40 N (y-dir).
Resultant R = âˆš(30Â² + 40Â²) = 50 N.

---

## **6. Moment of Force & Applications**

* **Moment = Force Ã— Perpendicular distance** from point.
* SI unit: NÂ·m.
* Causes rotation.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Opening a door (larger distance from hinge = easier to open).

---

## **7. Couples**

* Two equal and opposite parallel forces not in same line.
* Effect = pure rotation.
* **Moment of couple = Force Ã— distance between forces**

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Turning a steering wheel.

---

## **8. Resultant of Force System**

* Combine both **resultant force** and **resultant couple**.
* If multiple forces + couples act â†’ replace with single force + couple at reference point.

---

## **9. Equilibrium of System of Forces**

* Conditions:

  * Net force = 0
  * Net moment = 0

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Crane lifting load â†’ Tensions + load must balance.

---

## **10. Free Body Diagrams (FBD)**

* Diagram showing all external forces on body.
* Steps:

  1. Isolate body.
  2. Show forces (weight, reactions, applied forces).
  3. Write equilibrium equations.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Block on inclined plane â†’ show weight (W), normal reaction (N), friction (f), applied force (P).

---

## **11. Equations of Equilibrium of Coplanar Systems**

* For 2D rigid body:

  1. Î£Fx = 0
  2. Î£Fy = 0
  3. Î£M = 0

ðŸ‘‰ Example: Beam supported on two supports with load in middle. Use Î£Fx, Î£Fy, Î£M = 0 to find reactions.

# **Key Features**

1. **Force equilibrium** â†’ maintains rest/constant velocity.
2. **Rigid body equilibrium** â†’ also considers rotation.
3. **Couple** â†’ produces pure rotation, no translation.
4. **FBD** â†’ essential tool in mechanics.
5. **Equations of equilibrium** â†’ main method to solve reactions in supports, trusses, beams etc.
